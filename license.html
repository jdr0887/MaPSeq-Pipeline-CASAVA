Copyright (C) 2004 The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute this license document.

The intent of this license is to establish freedom to share and change

Granted Rights

1. You are granted the non-exclusive rights set forth in this license
provided you agree to and comply with any and all conditions in this
license. Whole or partial distribution of the Software, or software
items that link with the Software, in any form signifies acceptance of
this license.

2. You may copy and distribute the Software in unmodified form
provided that the entire package, including - but not restricted to -
copyright, trademark notices and disclaimers, as released by the
initial developer of the Software, is distributed.

3. You may make modifications to the Software and distribute your
modifications, in a form that is separate from the Software, such as
patches. The following restrictions apply to modifications:

a. Modifications must not alter or remove any copyright notices in the
Software.

b. When modifications to the Software are released under this license,
a non-exclusive royalty-free right is granted to the initial developer
of the Software to distribute your modification in future versions of
the Software provided such versions remain available under these terms
in addition to any other license(s) of the initial developer.

4. You may distribute machine-executable forms of the Software or
machine-executable forms of modified versions of the Software,
provided that you meet these restrictions:

a. You must include this license document in the distribution.

b. You must ensure that all recipients of the machine-executable forms
are also able to receive the complete machine-readable source code to
the distributed Software, including all modifications, without any
charge beyond the costs of data transfer, and place prominent notices
in the distribution explaining this.

c. You must ensure that all modifications included in the
machine-executable forms are available under the terms of this
license.

5. You may use the original or modified versions of the Software to
compile, link and run application programs legally developed by you or
by others.

6. You may develop application programs, reusable components and other
software items that link with the original or modified versions of the
Software. These items, when distributed, are subject to the following
requirements:

a. You must ensure that all recipients of machine-executable forms of
these items are also able to receive and use the complete
machine-readable source code to the items without any charge beyond
the costs of data transfer.

b. You must explicitly license all recipients of your items to use and
re-distribute original and modified versions of the items in both
machine-executable and source code forms. The recipients must be able
to do so without any charges whatsoever, and they must be able to
re-distribute to anyone they choose.

c. If the items are not available to the general public, and the
initial developer of the Software requests a copy of the items, then
you must supply one.  

Limitations of Liability

In no event shall the initial developers, copyright holders, the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, its trustees, officers,
employees or affiliates be liable for any damages whatsoever,
